# WildStar Tools, Packages, and Documentation

Hi there! Here you'll find a bunch of resources for creating Addons for the videogame [Wildstar](http://http://www.wildstar-online.com). 

This repository hosts all of the tools born out of [WildStar NASA](http://www.wildstarnasa.com) (Nexus Addon Standards Association), which is an Addon developer community trying to make Addon development as accessible as possible. One of the main NASA projects is **Gemini**, a set of open source Addons, Packages, and other tools for developers. 

You'll also find various user-created developer tools. Anyone is welcome to host their tools here, contribute to existing projects, create Issue tickets, etc. Let me know if you'd like to help out!
