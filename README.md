## WildStar Tools, Packages, and Documentation

Hi there! Here you'll find a bunch of resources for creating Addons for the videogame [WildStar](http://http://www.wildstar-online.com). Anyone is welcome to help with a project, fork one, or start their own!

This repository hosts all of the tools and documentation born out of [WildStar NASA](http://www.wildstarnasa.com) (Nexus Addon Standards Association), which is an Addon developer community trying to make Addon development as accessible as possible. One of the main NASA projects is **Gemini**, a set of open source Addons, Packages, and other tools for developers. Much of the private NASA Git repository has also been moved here, including NASADocs.

Another community resource is the [NASA Wiki](http://wiki.wildstarnasa.com).


### Repository Structure

The repository is structured similarly to the old NASA repository. Projects have been added as submodules under this repository, so you can check them all out by cloning this repository, or clone the other repositories individually.

I've made folders in NASADocs for the different types of community documentation there: 

- [Global Environment (_G) Dumps](https://github.com/wildstarnasa/NASADocs/_G%20Dumps)
- [Carbine Addons](https://github.com/wildstarnasa/NASADocs/Carbine Addons)
- [Apollo Events](https://github.com/wildstarnasa/NASADocs/Events)

If you contributed to the old NASADocs and your work isn't here yet, feel free to add it! However, since much of NASADocs is from before the NDA lift, it's preferable for things to come from the latest WildStar build.
